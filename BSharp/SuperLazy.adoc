Say we want to create an immutable `MagicCard` class, which:

- Always contains a `Name`
- Might contain a `Set`

We could declare that class as:

----
public record class MagicCard(string Name);
----

This would ensure that:

- `Name` must be set, either as:
** `new MagicCard("Borborygmos");`
** `new MagicCard { Name = "Borborygmos" };`

Now, we want to add a property for the `Block`:

- We can derive the `Block` from the `Name` by making a request to link:https://api.scryfall.com[]
- Making a request to Scryfall is *slow*, so we want to be as *lazy as possible*

- We've written a method, `Scryfall.GetBlock(string cardName)`

.Computed Property
----
public record class MagicCard(string Name){
    public string Block => Scryfall.GetBlock(Name);
}
----

- ✅ Doesn't call `Scryfall` in `new MagicCard()`
- ❌ Calls `Scryfall` whenever you call `MagicCard.Block`

.Readonly Field
----
public record class MagicCard(string Name){
    public readonly string Block = Scryfall.GetBlock(Name);
}
----

- ✅ Calls `Scryfall` at most 1 time
- ❌ _Always_ calls `Scryfall`

.Stored Property
----
public record class MagicCard(string Name){
    public string Block { get; } = Scryfall.GetBlock(Name);
}
----

- ❌ Same flaws as with a *Readonly Field*
