= "Hook" Methods

When a parent class wants to expose functionality that can be "partially" / "optionally" overloaded by children, rather than hoping that children will correctly call the `base` method, introduce a "hook" method.

- The parent method should be non-`virtual`.
- The parent method should be `public`.
- The "hook" method should have the same name as the parent method with the `_Hook` suffix.
- The "hook" method should be `virtual` or `abstract`.
- The "hook" method should be `protected`.

.Example
[source,c#]
----
public class Vehicle {
    public void Crash(){
        Console.WriteLine($"{this} crashed!");
        Crash_Hook();
    }

    protected virtual void Crash_Hook(){
        // to be overridden by child classes
    }
}

public class Car : Vehicle {
    protected override void Crash_Hook(){
        Console.WriteLine("Deploying airbags!");
    }
}
